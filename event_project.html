                    <h3>Depicting the Air. Russian Impressionism.</h3>
                    <p>
                        From February 14 to June 1, a large-scale exhibition “Depicting the Air. Russian Impressionism” will be held on three floors of the Museum of Russian Impressionism. Having become the main method for some and a short-term hobby for others, impressionism secured the right of artists to experiment with painting. The exhibition will feature works by 70 masters from Konstantin Korovin, Stanislav Zhukovsky and Igor Grabar to Pyotr Konchalovsky and Ilya Mashkov, as individual brushstrokes, that will come together to form a single picture and will allow us to imagine how large-scale and widespread this phenomenon was in the Russian artistic culture at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, the term “Russian impressionism” has become generally accepted: leading experts and institutions throughout Russia devote exhibition and publishing projects to this phenomenon, although even on the days of the museum’s opening in 2016, it caused controversy among art historians and viewers. With this project, the museum does not set itself the task of tracing the entire path of impressionism in Russia or creating a glossary of domestic masters-"impressionists". The exhibition will introduce the key features of the impressionist style and emphasize its national characteristics.
The exposition will open with canvases "depicting air" and revealing the nature of light. Following them, the work of painters with color will be presented. Russian artists, like their French colleagues, experimented with the palette and came to a dark range, unusual for the movement, with the effects of night lighting and St. Petersburg Neva water, for which the curator suggests the term "black impressionism".
Special attention will be paid to the sketches of Isaac Levitan, Leonid Pasternak, Leonard Turzhansky, for the first time equated by the impressionists with an independent work. This section will be continued by plein air compositions of Viktor Boris-Musatov, Nikolai Tarkhov and David Burliuk. The "Workshop" block will also be dedicated to the practice of impressionism, where the viewer will be able to enter the classrooms of the Academy of Arts and the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. Democratic subjects such as picnics, tea parties, boat rides, visits to cafes and theaters were also a discovery of impressionism. The "Russian motif" gained popularity: visitors will see how the vibrating boulevards of Paris were replaced by the streets of the provincial Russian towns of Konstantin Gorbatov and Pyotr Petrovichev, and how young peasant women performed by Abram Arkhipov replaced actresses in portraits. The master also borrowed innovative compositional techniques from photography and Japanese engraving: the works of Konstantin Kuznetsov, Igor Grabar and Vasily Perepletchikov will be presented in comparison with mass-produced graphics. The three floors of the museum will feature over 150 works from 76 private and state collections from all over the country from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok and Khabarovsk: the State Tretyakov Gallery, the State Russian Museum, the Vyatka Art Museum named after V.M. and A.M. Vasnetsov, as well as from the museum's own collection.
The conversation about the transfer of light and air in paintings, which began in the exhibition, will be continued by contemporary artist Irina Korina, whose great-great-grandfather Alexei Korin's works are also included in the exhibition. An installation dedicated to light as a physical phenomenon will be created in the museum's lobby especially for the exhibition. The work will focus the attention of viewers on the importance of scientific discoveries in the formation of a new pictorial language.
A book about Russian impressionism will be published for the exhibition. In the program article "Impressionism and its Environs: Russian Version", art critic Irina Vakar reflects on the path of the new movement in Russia and tells how impressionist techniques and methods helped Ilya Repin and Vasily Polenov, Konstantin Korovin and Valentin Serov, and after them Mikhail Larionov and Robert Falk in solving creative problems, as well as how plein air practices influenced Russian art. The album part will be supplemented by annotations about the works collected in the exhibition
with biographical information about the artists. In 2025, the museum will continue its cooperation with the Art, Science and Sport Charity Foundation as part of the Special View support program for people with visual impairments. With the participation of the partner of the inclusive program, tactile stations will be created. For the upcoming exhibition, their number will increase to six. Blind and visually impaired visitors will be able to get acquainted with tactile bas-reliefs to the works of Konstantin Korovin, Nikolai Feshin, Stanislav Zhukovsky, Abram Arkhipov, Igor Grabar and Ivan Kulikov both independently and on free excursions with audio description. After the exhibition, the models will be available to visitors to museums in Murom, Rybinsk, Kirov and Vladivostok.
An audio performance from the Theater Salon "Scene 23" will complement the impression of the paintings. Director Denis Azarov and composer Oleg Makarov created a special acoustic space where music combines with everyday sounds - whispers, footsteps - and helps to immerse oneself in the atmosphere of the exhibition. As part of the educational program for the exhibition, the museum will open a theater lounge - a series of meetings with leading directors

                        <h3>Volcanoes of Kamchatka</h3>
                        <p>
                            Volcanoes of Kamchatka — volcanoes in the east of Russia, on the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the Kamchatka Territory, are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire
                            It is difficult to strictly determine the exact number of volcanoes located on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Various sources mention from several hundred to more than a thousand volcanoes. 
                            Volcanoes of Kamchatka are characterized by a wide variety of shapes and sizes, they were formed in different geological eras and are currently active to varying degrees. Most of 
                            them are ancient volcanoes that are not currently active, but some volcanoes are active. For some volcanoes on the peninsula, the word "sopka" is often used instead of the word 
                            "volcano". Also, some volcanoes, especially extinct and low ones, are often simply called mountains.
